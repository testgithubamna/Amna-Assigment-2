I'm a student in class 9, currently enrolled in a GIAIC course, which has sparked my interest in technology and innovation. I enjoy exploring subjects like science and literature, and I love spending my free time with friends, playing sports, and diving into my favorite books. Balancing schoolwork and hobbies keeps me energized and curious about the world around me.
